Question 10: You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:
Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
The Binary Tree below illustrates the sample:

                     5
                  /     \
                2        8
              /   \     / \
             1     3   6   10
